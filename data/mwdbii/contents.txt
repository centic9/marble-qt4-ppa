 MWDBPOLY.ZIP is the complete database.

INFO:
=====

MWDBPOLY.ZIP contains a MWDBII database that is reasonably up to date, clean, 
and modified to provide closed polygons without using an index file. 
(Index files ARE available)

The following files are in MWDBPOLY.ZIP:

 PBORDER.TXT is a breakdown of PBORDER.PNT and notes on VECTOR graphics output.
  
 PCOAST.PNT (Header 1000 -1999) Note: Use this file when you don't want 
                                       Political Borders

                                         when you want Political borders

 PCANPROV.PNT (Header 4053 - 4064)   - original format where the headers
 PMEXICO.PNT (Header 4065 - 4100)    - 4000 to 4999 are reserved for

The coordinate data was collected by the Central Intelligence Agency.

The MICRO WORLD DATA BANK II Database was was produced and placed in the 
Public Domain by Fred Pospeschil and Antonio Rivera.

Charles Culberson (creator of Versamap) updated BORDER.PNT, added Australian
and Canadian internal political borders, modified RIVER.PNT, removed the 
Berlin air corridors from STATE.PNT, and moved the islands above Canada 
from LAKE.PNT to ISLAND.PNT (this product and more - sold as shareware).

Paul B. Anderson (of Global Associates, Ltd.) removed numerous duplicates 
from LAKE.PNT and ISLAND.PNT, added Mexican internal political borders (from 
data provided by US State Department), added Lakes Chad and Albert (Africa), 
matched end points of geographical features inside COAST.PNT, BORDER.PNT, 
ISLAND.PNT, LAKE.PNT, AUST.PNT, CANADA.PNT, and STATE.PNT to provide 
closed polygons.

MWDB-POLY was produced, at GLOBAL ASSOCIATES, Ltd., from Charles Culberson's 
version of the MWDB II to give existing programs that use the normal flat 
file PNT/MAP format a closed polygon capability when producing a vector 
graphics file output.
